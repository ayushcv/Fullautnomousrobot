# autonomousrobot

I am a student at Ching, just uploading the projects that me and my team have developed throughout these years. 
I created a technical product to help solve the problem of detecting different types of harmful gases in unreachable areas. This is the first fully autonomous 360 degrees robot with gas detecting feature in the Peel Region. The robot is connected to an app which sends accurate ppm levels in real time feedback to users.  It was developed with C++ based micro-controller, with external attachments of ultrasonic, current based gas sensors, Bluetooth module, and servo motors. App was developed in Java for Android Users.
